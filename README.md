## Git Instructions
### Starting a feature
To start a feature, use sourcetree and navigate to 'Repository->Git Flow->Start New Feature'. A feature is anything that you are adding to the game; assets, prefabs, code, edits to code, etc. After the feature branch has been created, push the branch to the remote so that it becomes visible on github and not just on your computer.

### Commiting to a feature
Commiting is gits way of 'saving' the changes you have made to github. In sourcetree, navigate to 'File Status' under 'Workspace' and stage all the files. Type a message in the commit message box that describes the changes you have made then press the commit button. After commiting, it is necessary to push the changes to the remote so that they are uploaded to github. Commiting should not just be done once a feature has been implemented but should be done periodically like a save function just in case something happens to the files on your computer.

### Finishing a feature
To finish a feature, use sourcetree and navigate to 'Repository->Create Pull Request' and select the feature branch you have been working on. It is setup so that no one can commit changes to the develop branch without a pull-request. This allows everyone time to review the changes/additions to make sure we can all agree that it should be implemented.
